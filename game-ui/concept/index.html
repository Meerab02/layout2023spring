    <title>Game Concept</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>Explore the galaxy, complete missions, and upgrade your spaceship to become the ultimate space adventurer. However, you have to do all this while you try and get away from the aliens chasing you.</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This game is similar to Temple Run and Subway Surfers. You have a set course or route you follow and you are trying to complete your mission, which is to collect as many stars (coins) as possible.
    </p>
    <p>You start out with a basic spaceship with limited capabilities. Each time you pass a planet you can refuel and each time you pass a moon you can double your star collection. 
    </p>
    <p>You only have limited fuel and are trying to complete your mission while escaping the aliens chasing you and avoiding the obstacles in the galaxy (comets, asteroids and black holes). You can use your stars/coins to buy better engines (that last longer), weapons and shields to add to your spaceship. You navigate obstacles buy swiping to jump, move left/right to collect stars.
    </p>

    <h2>UI Components:</h2>
    <p>Possible UI components include: flight instruments (altimeter, compass, clock), Mission guide (time to target, target indicator, mission-objective status, distance from home), a threat indicator, supply summary (ammunition, bombs, and fuel remaining), action bar (takeoff, land, fire machine gun, drop bomb, take picture). 
    </p>

    <p>I intend to build the <b>distance tracker, pause button, star/coin tracker, score, and fuel meter/gauge.</b> I will build the mission objectives (map route) and powerups (weapons, speed boost, etc.) if I have more time.</p>
